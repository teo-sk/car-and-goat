# Car and goat
The probability test game

This game simulates a solution for the [Monty Hall problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

To run it: (you will need nodejs and npm)

* Install deps with command `npm install`
* Run it with command `npm start`
* Play mode will be added later, so choose Simulate mode
* Enter the number of iterations to simulate

If you would like more output, turn on [debug logs](https://github.com/teo-sk/car-and-goat/blob/master/server.js#L10)
